# #1-Finding best path using BFS & DFS:

# #2-Finding best path using BFS calc & A*:
  1. Best First Search algorithm in which evaluation is done according to distance from the target point (F=H).
  2. Algorithm A* in which the evaluation is done according to the sum of the distance from the starting point
     & the distance from the left to the destination point (F=G+H).
     At the end of the algorithm, present the resulting path.
